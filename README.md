# 497R-Airframe-Design

Project 1: Basic airfoil performance analysis achieved through utilization of a Julia version of XFOIL develop by the FLOW lab

Project 2: Aerodynamic analysis on the performance of several airframes using the Vortex Lattice Method

Project 3: Design of 3 simple airframes where constraints are placed on weight, chord distribution, and twist distribution. Achieved through nonlinear optimization algorithms and derivative computation packages implemented in the Julia package SNOW.
